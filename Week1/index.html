        <P>
            My name is Liam Foushee. I am from Beaverton, Oregon, and I am studying computer science here at BYUI. I am
            the
            oldest of 4 kids. I have 2 younger brothers and 1 younger sister. Most of my hobbies have something to do
            with
            the outdoors. I enjoy camping, backpacking, running, as well as sports such as soccer. I love soccer. I grew
            up
            playing soccer and have stuck with it for most of my life. Besides playing soccer I also enjoy watching
            soccer.
            Being from close to Portland, me and my dad will often go watch the Portkland Timbers MLS team play. We love
            going to games and supporting our home team.
